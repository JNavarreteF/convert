# Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter

This is a web application built with Python and Flask that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Installation

To run this application, you will need to have Python 3 and Flask installed on your machine. You can install Flask by running the following command:

```
pip install flask
```

Once you have Flask installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask development server, and you should see output similar to the following:

```

```

You can now open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.
